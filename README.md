## 1.  Introduction
In this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Weather Conditions dataset to better understand the data before applying any predictive modeling.
EDA is an essential step in data science that helps to: 
   - Summarize the dataset structure and contents
   - Identify missing values and outliers
   - Explore relationships between numerical and categorical variables
   - Visualize trends and patterns through different plots


## 2. Python Libraries

I have Anaconda Python distribution installed on my system. It comes with most of the standard Python libraries I need for this project. The basic Python libraries used in this project are :
- **Numpy** → For numerical operations  
- **Pandas** → For data manipulation and preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib** → For plotting and visualizations  
- **Seaborn** → For advanced statistical graphics


## 3. Problem Statement

The objective is to explore the **Weather Conditions dataset** and extract meaningful insights such as weather trends, frequency of different conditions, relationships among numerical and categorical variables, and the presence of outliers or missing values.


## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of temperature, humidity, and wind speed  
- Frequency counts of weather conditions  

### 2. Bivariate Analysis
- Relationship between temperature and humidity  
- Weather condition vs. wind speed  

### 3. Multivariate Analysis
- Heatmap of correlations between numerical variables  

### 4. Outlier Detection
- Box plots and IQR method used for detecting outliers

### 5. Outlier Treatment
- log transformation and capping extreme values



## 5. Conclusion
EDA revealed useful patterns in the dataset, confirmed assumptions about variable relationships, and prepared the data for future modeling tasks such as predictive analytics.
